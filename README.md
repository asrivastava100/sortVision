Welcome to sortVision.

The file in the folder sorting_algorithms_standalone contains implementations of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort. There is also a test function to show that the algorithms produce the right results. These functions have been adapted for visualisation purposes and the adapted functions can be seen in the file SortFns.js (public folder).

frontEndFns.js contains all other front-end functions e.g. plot function and runSim (which runs the simulation on various events).

The files frontEndFns.js and SortFns.js should be used together as there are some dependencies through functions and global variables.
